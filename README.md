## Abouts 
Hello, I am Jiayi Niu, a student at the University of Virginia majoring in Mathematics and Applied Statistics. Throughout my academic journey, I have been deeply involved in various course projects that range from small-scale analyses to comprehensive research studies. Below is a brief overview of some of these projects, categorized by their scope and complexity.


## Projects

### STAT 3080 From Data to Knowledge Project
- **Description**: Collect data from at least two primary sources to answer research questions and analyze it in a R Markdown.
- **Technologies Used**: R
- **[PDF Report](https://github.com/JiayiNiu2023/Undergraduate_Projects/blob/main/Statistics_Project/STAT%203080%20Project%203.pdf)**

### STAT 3220 Intro to Regression Analysis Poster
- **Description**: 
For the poster presentation, my group and I investigated a research question of interest and presented our findings using bulleted lists, tables, and graphs. The poster included sections on the research question, data summary, and analysis, which involved either multiple linear regression or logistic regression. We also incorporated at least three additional techniques like weighted least squares or external model validation to enhance our analysis. The poster concluded with interpretations of the results and suggestions for future research improvements.
- **Technologies Used**: SAS
- **[PDF Report](https://github.com/JiayiNiu2023/Undergraduate_Projects/blob/main/Statistics_Project/STAT%203220%20Final%20Project.pdf)**

### STAT 3220 Intro to Regression Analysis Report
- **Description**: 
In the 3-page written report, we detailed the research question, provided a comprehensive data summary, and described the analysis process. The report adhered to specific formatting guidelines and included sections on methods, results, and conclusions. The analysis met stringent criteria, such as model building and significance testing. We also discussed the limitations of our research and areas for future study, ensuring that the report was both comprehensive and insightful.

### STAT 4160 Experimental Design
- **Description**: 
In our group project, we analyzed factors affecting putting accuracy in golf using a 2^4 factorial design. We focused on four variables: length of putt, type of putter, break, and slope. Statistical methods like EDA and ANOVA were employed. After a square root transformation to meet model assumptions, we found that putt length and putter type significantly impact accuracy.
- **Technologies Used**: R
- **[PDF Report](https://github.com/JiayiNiu2023/Undergraduate_Projects/blob/main/Statistics_Project/STAT%204160%20Project.pdf)**

### STAT 4630 Machine Learning Milestone 3 and Milestone 4
- **Description**: 
Our group project is currently in progress and aims to identify the key financial factors affecting a borrower's eligibility to meet LendingClub.com's credit underwriting criteria. Utilizing logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis, we have found that FICO credit score, among other variables, is a significant predictor. Our improved logistic regression model has shown promising results with an AUC of 0.921. However, some variables like 'dti' and 'delinq.2yrs' have yielded unexpected outcomes, which we plan to investigate further. As the next steps in our analysis, we intend to employ tree-based methods and random forests to enhance the model's predictive accuracy. The study aims to offer actionable insights for both borrowers and investors upon completion.
